(3, 'Smoked Gouda Pasta Bake', '1 (12 ounce) package shell pasta
2 ½ tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 ½ cups milk
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground white pepper
4 ounces smoked Gouda cheese, shredded', 'Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a casserole dish.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add shell pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes.
While the pasta is cooking, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Gradually whisk in milk, salt, and pepper, then bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until sauce is smooth and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 5 to 10 minutes.
Drain pasta and transfer to a large bowl. Pour cheese sauce over top and mix until thoroughly combined. Transfer to the prepared casserole dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 15 minutes.', 'Nutrition Facts (per serving)

(1, 'Cheese & Onion Quiche', '1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for the tin
plain flour, for dusting
320g pack ready rolled shortcrust pastry
1 white onion, finely chopped
large bunch of spring onions, finely sliced
4 eggs, plus 1 egg yolk
250ml whole milk
small bunch of chives, finely chopped
150g mature cheddar, grated
green salad (optional)', 'Lightly grease a 23cm loose-bottomed, fluted flan tin with a pastry brush. Lightly dust a clean work surface with the flour and tip the pastry out onto it. Roll out the pastry into a circle that’s larger than the flan tin. Gently lay the pastry into the tin and press carefully into the base and sides. Leave any overhang over the sides of the tin. Chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a frying pan over a low-medium heat. Stir in the onion with a large pinch of salt and fry gently for 15 minutes until beginning to soften. Add the spring onions and cook for a few minutes until slightly softened. Transfer to a plate and leave to cool slightly.
Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Scrunch up a sheet of baking parchment and line the tin, ensuring it goes over the edges. Fill with baking beans, all the way up the sides of the tin. Bake for 15-20 minutes. Remove the beans and parchment and bake for a further 5-10 minutes until lightly golden and sandy to the touch. If the pastry has puffed up, gently press it down using a cold, metal spoon. Once cooled slightly, trim the pastry edges.
While the pastry is baking, whisk together the eggs, egg yolk, milk and chives in a jug. Season well with salt and black pepper.
Reduce the oven temperature to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Place the flan tin on a baking sheet and scatter the onions evenly over the base. Sprinkle over most of the grated cheddar and pour over the egg mixture. Top with the remainder of the cheese and bake for 25-30 minutes, until set and lightly golden; the middle should have a very slight jiggle. Remove and allow to cool for 10-15 minutes before slicing. Serve warm along with a crispy green salad, if you like.', 'Nutrition Facts (per serving)
